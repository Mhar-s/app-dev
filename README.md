# Here Are Some of My Favorite Movies and Series
- A movie named "Astro Boy" I really enjoy the movie because it’s a heartfelt and exciting story that mixes action with deeper emotional themes. It’s about a young robot trying to find his place in a world where he feels different, which is something a lot of people can relate to. I love how it shows that being "human" isn’t about what you’re made of but about the choices you make and the kindness you show.
- There is a series named "Arcane" that is worth watching. An incredible animated series set in the world of League of Legends, and as a fan of the game, I couldn’t resist watching it. The show dives into the backstories of characters like Jinx and Vi, showing how their lives are shaped by the tension between Piltover’s rich upper city and the gritty, struggling undercity of Zaun. What really hooked me was the emotional depth of the story—seeing these characters I knew from the game come to life in such a detailed and heartbreaking way was amazing. The animation is stunning, the action is intense, and the storytelling is so good it pulls you right in. It gave me a whole new love for the League universe, and I’d recommend it to anyone, even if they don’t play the game!
